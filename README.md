Welcome to **OrniFlight**, the open-source flight control software specifically designed for servo flapping ornithopters. Built on the robust Betaflight platform, OrniFlight brings advanced servo-based propulsion and cutting-edge aerodynamic optimization to the fascinating realm of flapping wing flight.

## Introduction

**OrniFlight** is an innovative flight control solution aimed at enthusiasts and researchers working with ornithopters. Unlike traditional quadcopters and fixed-wing aircraft, ornithopters mimic the natural flight mechanics of birds, requiring precise control of servo mechanisms to achieve efficient and stable flight. OrniFlight is tailored to meet these unique requirements, providing a versatile and powerful tool for anyone looking to explore this exciting field.

### Focus on Servo-Based Flapping Propulsion

OrniFlight replaces traditional motor outputs with oscillating servos that drive the flapping motion of the wings. This servo-based propulsion system enables realistic and efficient flapping wing motion, closely emulating the flight mechanics of birds and other flying creatures. The precise control offered by servos allows for fine-tuning of wing motion, resulting in improved flight stability and performance.

## Key Features

- **Servo-Based Propulsion**: Tailored for precise control of servo mechanisms, enabling realistic and efficient flapping wing motion.
- **Advanced Aerodynamics**: Integrates the latest aerodynamic theories to enhance flight stability and performance.
- **Customizable Settings**: Offers a wide range of configurable options to fine-tune flight characteristics according to specific designs and requirements.
- **Open Source**: Developed as an open-source project, encouraging community involvement and continuous improvement.

## Installation

To get started with OrniFlight, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OrniFlight.git
   cd OrniFlight
   ```

2. **Set Up Your Development Environment**:
   - Ensure you have the required toolchain and dependencies installed. Refer to the Betaflight [development setup guide](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/wiki/Building-Betaflight) for detailed instructions.

3. **Compile the Firmware**:
   - Replace `YOUR_TARGET` with your specific flight controller target (e.g., `TINYFISH`):
     ```bash
     make TARGET=YOUR_TARGET
     ```

4. **Flash the Firmware**:
   - Use Betaflight Configurator or another suitable tool to flash the compiled firmware to your flight controller.
