## Oscillating Normalized Dynamic Adaptive Stabilization (ONDAS)

Oscillating Normalized Dynamic Adaptive Stabilization (ONDAS) is an innovative stabilization system specifically designed for flapping or oscillating systems. 
By focusing on the central, most powerful part of the oscillating wave, ONDAS dynamically adapts to real-time data to maintain optimal stability and control while preventing the system from being destabilized by its own oscillations. This system leverages advanced normalization and dynamic adjustment techniques to minimize the impact of extreme errors, ensuring efficient and stable performance in varying conditions.


### Key Features

* **Oscillating Focus**: ONDAS emphasizes the stabilization of systems with inherent oscillating or flapping motions. It intelligently adjusts to the natural rhythm of the system, ensuring smooth and efficient operation.
* **Normalized Error Management**: By normalizing error inputs through focus on the central part of the oscillation where the most thrust and control authority are generated, ONDAS reduces the influence of extreme deviations introduced by flapping wings.
* **Dynamic Adaptation**: ONDAS adjusts control parameters in real-time to maintain stability and prevent overshooting, especially during the powerful central phases of the flapping motion.
* **Centralized Control**: The system prioritizes the central phase of the oscillation, where the most thrust and control authority are generated. This focus helps in achieving precise stabilization and avoiding overshooting.


### How It Works

1. *Error Filtering*: ONDAS applies an alpha filter to the error term based on the oscillation phase, throttle input, and user-defined control variables. This filtering process reduces the influence of extreme errors and focuses on the most controllable and predictable part of the wave.
2. *Adaptive PID Control*: The filtered error is used in the PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control loop. The PID parameters are dynamically adjusted to adapt to changing conditions, ensuring responsive and stable control.
3. *Seamless Integration*: ONDAS integrates with the flapping control loop, ensuring that stabilization efforts complement the natural motion of the system without interfering with its power and efficiency.

### Benefits

* Improved Stability: Prevents destabilization caused by the systemâ€™s own oscillations, ensuring smooth and efficient operation.
* Optimized Control: Focuses on the central part of the oscillation to achieve precise stabilization and avoid overshooting.
* Real-Time Adaptation: Continuously adapts to real-time conditions, providing robust stabilization even in rapidly changing environments.
